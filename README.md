## Overview
'aimap' is a Python3 module that provides support for finding the modification from Adenosine to inosine (A to I). This is a one-step automated A to I modification analysis pipeline (AIMAP) for bacteria that works on illumine RNA-seq raw reads. 
The pipeline integrates reads quality control, adaptor removal, reference genome mapping, coverage pileup and synonymous-nonsynonymous annotation.
